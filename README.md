### :muscle: Project
HCL's Power Object .net team Project
The project is a Matching App focused on career and professional relationships.

Consists of .NET in the back end and Angular for the front end. The architecture style is based on many
design patterns, like the use of repositories for data access, role management, centralized error handlleing, and the use of websockets.

The app main features are user Registration and Login, member Sorting and Filtration allowing other users to customize their preferences,
Photos uploading through a thrid party service, and instant messaging so users can communicate when they feel 
like they can collaborate on a project or if someone could be a good fit for a position.

Extras: GitHub actions, CI/CD pipeline and Azure deployment.
